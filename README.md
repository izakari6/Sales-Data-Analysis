# Sales-Data-Analysis
Exploration and Visual Analysis

Sales data shows the recordings of transactions between a seller and their customers. It is one of the important documentations that help a seller make well informed decisions and know how good or bad sales are going.

In this project, I am looking at analysing a dataset that was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/knightbearr/analysis-sales-data-knightbearr/input).
The aim is to know,
1. Sales revenue based on City.
2. Revenue generation based on Month, Quarter, and Year.
3. Peak sales hours
4. Highest selling product by Revenue and Quantity

# Data Dictionary

1. Order ID - An Order ID is the number system that Amazon uses exclusively to keep track of orders. Each order receives its own Order ID that will not be duplicated.This number can be useful to the seller when attempting to find out certain details about an order such as shipment date or status.
2. Product - The product that have been sold.
3. Quantity Ordered - Ordered Quantity is the total item quantity ordered in the initial order (without any changes).
4.  Price Each - The price of each products.
5.  Price Each - The price of each products.
6.  Order Date - This is the date the customer is requesting the order be shipped.
7.   Purchase Address - The purchase order is prepared by the buyer, often through a purchasing department. The purchase order, or PO, usually includes a PO number, which is useful in matching shipments with purchases; a shipping date; billing address; shipping address; and the request items, quantities and price.
    
 # Data Preparation
 One of the impotant steps in preparing data for analysis is data cleaning and it is of the activities that consumes a lot of time. If data is not properly cleaned it will output wrong analysis.
